You are an expert full-stack developer and product designer. I want you to fully generate a complete project for a hackathon submission based on the following requirements.

Project Name: SafeConnect: Offline Disaster Communication Network

Project Description:
SafeConnect is a web and mobile app that allows users to communicate, share location, and status updates during disasters, **without internet or GSM connectivity**, using peer-to-peer connections. AI can only be used as an auxiliary tool (e.g., message prioritization), **the core functionality must not rely on AI**.

Requirements:
1. Fully functional offline P2P messaging system using WebRTC or local peer discovery.
2. Location sharing and visualization on a map (Mapbox or equivalent).
3. Quick-action status buttons: "Safe", "Help Needed", "Water/Shelter".
4. Offline storage using IndexedDB or similar.
5. Optional AI: minimal message analysis or prioritization. **Do not generate content or handle main functionality with AI**.
6. Fully responsive and modern UI/UX using React + TailwindCSS.
7. Deployment-ready project structure (frontend + optional backend FastAPI).

Deliverables:
1. **PRD.md**: Complete product requirements document.
2. **requirements_analysis.md**: Functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, dependencies, and risk analysis.
3. **UI Mockups**: Screens, buttons, map, colors, layout — suggest Figma or Tailwind CSS components.
4. **Frontend code structure**: React + Tailwind + WebRTC integration.
5. **Backend code structure** (optional): FastAPI endpoints for peer signaling if needed.
6. **Demo video script** (3-minute outline showing the app workflow).
7. **Folder structure and file names** for GitHub deployment.

Instructions:
- Generate all deliverables in structured markdown or code blocks.
- Include explanations for design choices, folder structure, and libraries used.
- Assume the user has minimal time to code, so generate ready-to-run code skeletons where possible.
- The final output should be **complete enough to implement and submit to the hackathon**.

Output format:
- PRD.md content in a markdown code block.
- requirements_analysis.md content in a markdown code block.
- UI mockup description and Tailwind component examples.
- Folder structure tree.
- Code skeletons for frontend and backend (React + FastAPI).
- Demo video script with timestamps and actions.
