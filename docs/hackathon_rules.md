## 6. 1st Place Strategy Suggestions

To maximize chances of winning:

### a) **Functionality (40%)**
- Make sure the project works **without bugs**.  
- Provide **clear user instructions**, even in the demo.  
- Offline/online capabilities or live demo are plus points.

### b) **Creativity (30%)**
- Solve **real-world problems** (disaster response, environmental issues, education).  
- Use **existing tools in new ways** (e.g., WebRTC offline messaging, OCR for recycling).  
- Combine **unexpected elements** (e.g., gamification + habit tracking + social impact).

### c) **Execution (20%)**
- Learn a **new framework or API** (React, Mapbox, WebRTC, FastAPI, IndexedDB).  
- Implement technical challenges such as peer-to-peer networking.  
- Showcase advanced features clearly in video.

### d) **Polish (10%)**
- Modern, responsive UI (Tailwind or custom CSS).  
- Smooth animations, clear icons, consistent color palette.  
- Include a **demo script** highlighting the best UI/UX interactions.

### e) **Extra Tips**
- Keep AI **out of the main functionality**, use only as assistant.  
- Create a **story-driven demo video** — even 2–3 minutes is enough to impress.  
- Provide **GitHub repo or live link** for judges to test easily.  
- Consider **social impact or accessibility** — judges love projects that help people.

**Conclusion:**  
EHC OpenHack rewards **creativity, technical skill, polish, and originality**. Focus on a **clear, functional, visually appealing project** that solves a real-world problem, document everything, and present it compellingly in a short video.
